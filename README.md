Visual representation of this area to be maximized by an exhaustive algorithm.Because the product of durations <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\normalsize&space;d_i"> and the absolute difference <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\normalsize&space;|r-r_i|">  are technically areas, we must find the start and stop (or the lower and upper limits of d2) such that the sum of the three areas is maximized.
